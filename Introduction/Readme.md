## Hi :wave:

### Let's get started with C++ :rocket:

#### What is C++?

C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, and Oracle. The C++ standard library provides support for tasks such as string manipulation, I/O, memory allocation, data structures, etc.

#### Why C++?

C++ is a middle-level language, as it comprises a combination of both high-level and low-level language features. It was designed with a bias for system programming and embedded, resource-constrained and large systems, with performance, efficiency and flexibility of use as its design highlights.

#### What can you do with C++?

C++ is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained and large systems, with performance, efficiency and flexibility of use as its design highlights.

#### What are the applications of C++?

C++ is used to create operating systems, browsers, games, and so on. It is also used in the development of the Linux kernel, Apache web server, Mozilla Firefox, and Google Chrome.

#### What are the advantages of C++?

#### What are the disadvantages of C++?

- C++ is a complex language.

- It is difficult to learn and master but don't worry, you will get there.

#### What are the prerequisites for learning C++?

- Basic knowledge of any programming language.

Don't worry, nothing much. You will learn everything from scratch.
