## First Program (Hello World)

This is a simple program that prints "Hello World!" to the console.

### Code

You can find the code written by me [here](/First%20Program%20%E2%9E%A1%20Hello%20World/first_program.cpp).

**Note: It can be written in many ways, this is just one of them.**

### Output

```bash
Hello World!
```

### Explanation

- `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` is a header file that includes every standard library.
- `using namespace std;` is used to avoid writing `std::` before every standard library function.
- `int main()` is the main function where the execution of the program starts.
- `cout << "Hello World!" << endl;` is used to print "Hello World!" to the console and `endl` is used to print a new line.
- `return 0;` is used to return 0 to the operating system.
